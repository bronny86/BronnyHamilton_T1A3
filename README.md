## Code Styling Guide

***

I chose to follow the Python Code style guide PEP 8 for all of my coding for this project.

PEP 8 dictates using four spaces for indentation rather than tabs, a maximum line length of 79 characters, seperating top-level function and classes with two blank lines while seperating method definitions inside classes with one blank line.

I elected to use autopep8 in VS Code to auto-adjust my code, once I was finished writing a piece of code I would simple right-click on the text, select 'Format Document' and if there was anything I had missed that didn't adhere to the PEP 8 conventions, autopep would adjust it for me.
